☐ Gets [object, Object] when i choose goods for user

☐ Email + Phone = undefined in Goods 
It should be there, other props need to be there
☐ Employees email = undefiend 
But they dont have it anymore!

☐ For everything writes Edit User button
But needs to write Edit User/Good/Employee

☐ When im switching tabs just writes Users
Needs to write current category

☐ Stats just like Users stats, not like Good stats/Employee stats
But needs to write also current category!
